These are the batch files the Vim installer places in %SYSTEMROOT% to make vim/gvim work from the command line.  If Vim is installed on the system through other means, these can be placed in %SYSTEMROOT% or another directory in PATH to replicate the functionality.

Remember to set the path variable correctly.
