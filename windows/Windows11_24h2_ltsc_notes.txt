Disabling Windows Defender
To disable Windows Defender using group policy, tamper protection needs to be disabled. 
Use the Windows Security app, go to "Virus & Threat protection", turn off tamper proof (ideally all the options if you are disabling it).
You can then use the the group policy setting to disable Defender:
Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Microsoft Defender Antivirus > Turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus (choose Enabled).
Then run gpupdate /force.

If you open Windows Security after using this method, and go to Virus & threat protection, there will be a warning: "Your Virus & threat protection is managed by your organization." and "No active antivirus provider. Your device is vulnerable."

On Server 2025, you can still disable it through Server Manager or PowerShell.
